Hello, I am Nikolay.

I work as Engineering Manager with a focus on bridging the gap between business and technology.
I have worked with both (cloud) infrastructure, as well as software development teams.

In my spare time I roast coffee, I read books (mostly with a philosophical touch) and I like to enjoy nature (hiking and swimming).
