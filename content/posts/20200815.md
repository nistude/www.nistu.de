When I create references to web pages in [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), I
like to create snapshots of those pages to ensure perpetual access. However,
some sites are notoriously problematic to snapshot because they make heavy
use of JavaScript or are behind some kind of paywall.

The other day I came across
[a comment](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/comment/347897/#Comment_347897)
in the Zotero forum that hints at a setup for taking semi-automatic
PDF snapshots of web pages. Unfortunately, this feature is not integrated in
plain Zotero but with just two add-ons, we can mostly automate it.

# Install and Configure Add-ons

The workflow depends on two Zotero add-ons, Zotfile and Zutilo. Zotfile provides
a feature to attach a directory's newest file to an item, so that we won't
have to select it manually. Zutilo allows us to create a keyboard shortcut
for this feature, further simplifying the workflow.

## Install Zotfile

The installation of Zotfile is
[well documented](http://zotfile.com/#how-to-install--set-up-zotfile)
and describes configuration of the folder from which to choose files to add.

I like to use a temporary folder for this workflow, as the PDF will be copied
into a Zotero folder automatically and I prefer to keep my directories clean of
unused files.

## Install Zutilo

Zutilo's installation is also
[well documented](https://github.com/willsALMANJ/Zutilo#installation).

Afterwards we can configure a shortcut for Zotfile's `Attach new file`
functionality. For this, we go to `Tools -> Zutilo Preferences -> Shortcuts ->
Attach new file` and select a memorable shortcut. In case of conflicts with
existing shortcuts, Zutilo will tell us.

I chose `CTRL + P` to attach the new file which gives me a nice memory hook
after pressing `CTRL + P` in the browser to save as PDF right before.

# The workflow to take PDF snapshots of web pages

With the required add-ons installed, we can now take a look at the workflow.

## 1) Print the web page to PDF

The first step is to create a PDF version of the web page. This is easily
done by pressing `CTRL + P` and choosing `Save as PDF`. Be sure to save the
PDF into the same folder that you configured for Zotfile above.

## 2) Create a new item for the web page in Zotero

With the [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/) installed,
creating a new item from the browser is as easy as pressing `CTRL + Shift + S`
(Firefox users
[go here](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/76073/solved-zotero-connector-shortcut-conflict-with-firefox)).

## 3) Attach the PDF to that new item

Now we switch over to Zotero where we probably want to complete the new item's
records anyways. With a quick call to our Zutilo shortcut, `CTRL + P` in my
case, we can add that PDF snapshot to the item.

# Tips and tricks

## Replace HTML snapshots with PDF snapshots

If you want to replace HTML snapshots with PDF snapshots altogether, you can
disable HTML snapshots in Zotero. Go to `Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced ->
General -> Config Editor` and type `snapshot` into the search bar. It should
find a preference called `extensions.zotero.automaticSnapshots` that you can
set to `false` by double clicking.

## Reduce junk in PDFs

Many websites have footers with related content or long lists of comments. To
keep that stuff out of the printed PDF, I like to limit the pages printed.

## Remove overlay artefacts from PDFs

Sometimes you can see visible fragments from JavaScript overlays in print
preview. If that is the case, you can use the developer console to remove
relevant elements from the page's DOM and get a clean print.
